# Patient-Metrics

To build a real-time dashboard for patient metrics in Tableau, I would take the following approach:

#Gathering and Integrating Data:
I would first ensure I have access to the data sources containing patient information, like electronic health records or other databases.
For real-time tracking, it's crucial that these data sources support live updates, this can be SQL databases like Oracle which are updated in real time using a batch job or a cron job that run periodically.

#Data Preparation:
I would clean and format the data appropriately, which might involve standardizing formats, addressing missing values, and summarizing data.
I’d identify the key patient metrics that I need to track, such as vital signs, patient admissions, and duration of hospital stays.
Note: I used sample fake data to rendered this dashboard(attached in folder).

#Dashboard Design:
In designing the dashboard, I would choose the most appropriate visual representations for each metric, like charts, graphs, or tables.
I would also incorporate interactive elements like filters and detailed views to enable users to dive deeper into the data.

#Implementing Real-Time Features:
I would set up the dashboard to refresh data at the necessary intervals. I’d utilize Tableau’s alert feature to notify relevant stakeholders when certain predefined conditions are met.

#Testing and Validation:
I would ensure the dashboard accurately reflects the data and updates as expected.
I would also test the dashboard’s performance, especially if dealing with large datasets or complex calculations.

#Deployment and User Training:
Once the dashboard is tested, I would deploy it for use by the intended audience.(This can be done using Tableau premium subscription).
I would provide training or documentation to help users understand how to interact with and interpret the dashboard.
Note: This project is hosted on Tableau Public platform.

#Maintenance and Iteration:
I would establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the dashboard based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
Regular monitoring and updating of the dashboard would be necessary, especially when there are changes in data sources or business needs.
My goal in this process would be to create a dashboard that's not only technically efficient but also intuitive and insightful for its users.
